Before class on Monday, 4/27, we plan on implementing the following tasks into our project:

  - Solve the differential equation for air drag which we will use in our work.
  - Create an outline/background that is almost like a textbook excerpt of what we will be doing and the question we are asking.
  - Code a plot of projectile motion without air drag for reference.
  - Get our code working for the projectile motion with air drag and create plots.
  
  
  
For version control and to avoid duplication we are going to Zoom before we both begin on the project for the day and allocate what each of us will work on and then do this work in our own branch. At the end of class time we will communicate again about what we did and then decide what will be put into the master branch.
