We plan on implementing the following tasks into our project:

  - Solve the differential equation for air drag which we will use in our work. (In Progress)
  
  - Create an outline/background that is almost like a textbook excerpt of what we will be doing and the question we are asking. (In Progress)
  
  - Code a plot of projectile motion without air drag for reference. (Done)
      - Update projectile motion without air drag to include the same angles as with air drag 
          *We want to obtain the final x-displacement of the projectile for each angle to compare to the air drag x-displacements (make a table)
      -The x-displacement values should be greater than the air drag values 
          
  - Get our code working for the projectile motion with air drag and create plots.(Done)
      *This function and plots shows the projectile motion with air drag having varying angles of launch 
      -Now create a table of the final x-displacement for each angle
      - We want to compare the results of projectile motion with air drag to without air drag so that we can determine the effect of air drag on different balls
      -We expect the air drag to decrease the x-displacement compared to a projectile without air drag.
  -Once we create plots and tables with and without air drag we must compare results and describe what this means
  
  
For version control and to avoid duplication we are going to Zoom before we both begin on the project for the day and allocate what each of us will work on and then do this work in our own branch. At the end of class time we will communicate again about what we did and then decide what will be put into the master branch.
