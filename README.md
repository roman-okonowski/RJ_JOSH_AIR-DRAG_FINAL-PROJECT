This repository contains the files written in Python by RJ Okonowski and Josh Harris for the PHY325 final project. 
The code in these files are used to explore the physcs behind throwing a ball. We will explore how elevation, launch angle/velocity,
and air drag affects the projectile motion of a ball. To install this code, simply clone this repository and open 
the desired IPYNB file in Jupyter. If the plotly module is not found when trying to run the tables in the master file, then the plotly module must be installed to your device.
