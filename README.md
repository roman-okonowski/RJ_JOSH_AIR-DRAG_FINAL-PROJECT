This repository contains the files written in Python by RJ Okonowski and Josh Harris for the CS325 final project. 
The code in these files are used to explore the physcs behind throwing a ball. We will explore how elevation, spin,
and air drag affects the projectile motion of a ball. To install this code, simply clone this repository and open 
the desired IPYNB file in Python. As of now, there are no other files that need to be downloaded for our code to
run successfully.
